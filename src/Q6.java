/*
You are tasked with writing a processOrderStatus method that takes an OrderStatus enum as input and returns a descriptive string based on the order status.
Here's the OrderStatus enum: public enum OrderStatus { PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED }
Your processOrderStatus method should adhere to the following rules:
For PENDING orders, return: "Order is awaiting confirmation."
For PROCESSING orders, return: "Order is being prepared." For SHIPPED orders, return: "Order has been dispatched."
For DELIVERED orders, return: "Order has been successfully delivered."
For CANCELLED orders, return: "Order has been canceled."
For REFUNDED orders, return: "Refund has been issued for the order." Use a single switch expression to achieve this.
Enhancements: yield Keyword:If your logic requires more complex processing within a case, demonstrate the use of the yield keyword to return a value from the switch expression.
